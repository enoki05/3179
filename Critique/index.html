      </div>
      <p>
        The inner areas of Australia are on the lower end of employment due to businesses being predominantly located in outer regions, leading to a higher concentration of jobs there. 
        This trend is particularly evident in metropolitan areas where outer suburbs host a significant number of employment opportunities.
