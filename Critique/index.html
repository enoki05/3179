        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 500px;">
          The recruitment data reveals significant regional variation, with the Northern Territory consistently showing the highest recruitment rates throughout the period, peaking at 0.76 in August 2022, while New South Wales maintained the lowest rates below 60%.
          The highest recruitment rates for all regions were observed between 2021 and 2022, likely due to post-pandemic economic recovery efforts, followed by a general decline in 2023 and 2024 as the market stabilised. At present, all regions have recruitement rates 
          between 40-65%, with Victoria and the ACT having the lowest rates of 41% and 42% respectively, hence indicating a more competative job market.

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The amount of new positions was very high in 2020 likely due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. From then on, staff turnover grew and became a big reason for recruitment. There 
        has also been a growth in undesirable and inexperienced workers applying for positions compared to previous years and many more people are applying to jobs in 2025. The 
        number of stages in the recruitment process has also increased over time, indicating a more rigorous hiring process by companies likely due to increased competition.

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 500px;">
          The number of applicants has risen since 2020 indicating stronger competition, but the suitability of applicants has decreased. In 2025, roughly 16% of applicants are deemed suitable for a job, whereas in 2020, 22% were suitable. This indicates a growing skills mismatch in the labour market.
          During 20221 and 2022, the number of applicants was greater than that of 2020, but the number of suitable and qualified applicants were lower. This means that during this period, people were likely mass
          applying for jobs due to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but many lacked the necessary skills or experience.
